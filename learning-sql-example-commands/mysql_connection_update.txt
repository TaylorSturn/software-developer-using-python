   In order to run the mysql examples from the book you need to run the mysqlsh
utitity in either the "cmd" or "windows power shell" window. Once the window is
open type "mysqlsh" which will take over the window.

   Once the "mysqlsh" shell is running issue the following commands to create
  the same environment that is shown in the book. 

\connect root@localhost:3306

   This connection will prompt you for login credentials that you should have
created during the installation. Once connected you will need to change the
mode back to the sql which is the mode that the book uses with the command
below.

\sql


   For the examples in the book you must use the sakila database which is not
  connected by default. You must issue the command below to start using this
  database.

use sakila 

\connect root@localhost:3306
\sql
use sakila
